On Tue 30th July 2024, we had a great day at Code by the Coast, at The Heights, Portland, Dorset. OSGeo:UK's latest code sprint brought 18 people together to work on a number of FOSS4G projects, including Terra Draw and GIFramework Maps.

> "The code sprint let us introduce GIFramework Maps to new developers and will help us to start growing the community for the project. We looked at some important topics including getting the application to translate into other languages like Welsh.

> "On behalf of the development team, we’d like to thank everyone that took time to work with us and look forward to working with you and others in the future."

> *GIFramework Maps Team*

> "The codesprint was a great opportunity to get people familiarised with Terra Draw and improve the onboarding experience onto the project. We had five pull requests in total, focusing on documentation and testing of the application. We also found a bug with the OpenLayers adapter which wouldn't have been uncovered and diagnosed without the help of the participants (it was a Windows only issue!)."

> *James Milner, Terra Draw*

We also progressed the registration of Terra Draw, GIFramework Maps and XYZ as OSGeo Community projects, and spent a bit of time looking at OGC API Standards including EDR (Environmental Data Retrieval) and the Marine Tools QGIS Plugin.

Along with the great coding and networking, we also had some lovey views in an excellent venue. It was rather warm though, but The Heights rose to the challenge and provided us with iced coffee!

Many thanks to both OSGeo:UK GoFundGeo and Addresscloud for sponsoring the event, and for those participants who paid for their own tickets - we couldn't have done it without you!

We will be running our first UK code sprint, Code by the Coast, on Tuesday 30th July 2024, at the The Heights Hotel, Portland, Dorset, UK. [~~Book your tickets now~~](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/osgeouk-2024-code-sprint-tickets-870353269057). SOLD OUT. Please email us on <span class="osgeoemail"></span> if you have any questions. 

**All attendees should have recieved a welcome email with information on the day. If you haven't, please email us ASAP.**

This is a great opportunity to work on some up and coming open-source projects and to meet up with other open-source developers here in the UK. Whether you are new to open-source geospatial development or have been working in the industry for years we hope this event will be the summer work-cation you need!

**Bring your device and join us at the Portland Heights Hotel where you can choose to work on any number of the open-source applications on offer.**

### Projects

- **Terra Draw**
    - A library for drawing on maps that supports Mapbox, MapLibre, Google Maps, OpenLayers and Leaflet out the box
    - [GitHub repo - JamesLMilner/terra-draw](https://github.com/JamesLMilner/terra-draw)
	- [Issue for OSGeo:UK Code Sprint](https://github.com/JamesLMilner/terra-draw/issues/283)

- **How to register your Open Source Geospatial project as an OSGeo Community Project**
	- Registering your project as an OSGeo Community project is a great way of saying that your project is open source, and open to contributors. Nick Bearman will outline the process, and be on hand to help different projects register. The key elements to be an OSGeo Community Project are:
		- Be geospatial
		- Have a free license or an open source license.
		- Welcome participation and new contributors.
	- More info at [OSGeo Incubation Committee](https://www.osgeo.org/about/committees/incubation/) and [OSGeo Community Projects](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo_Community_Projects).
	
- **OGC API standards, in particular Environmental Data Retrieval, and CoverageJSON**
    - A QGIS Plugin to support access to servers using the OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval (EDR) standard, with one of the outputs formats being CoverageJSON - not currently supported directly in QGIS. Useful to add?
    - [OGC API - EDR](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/edr/)
	- [QGIS Plugin](https://github.com/MetOffice/qgis-plugin-edr)
