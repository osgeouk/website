### UK Code Sprint

![](images/code-by-the-coast.jpg)

We will be running a UK code sprint this summer on Tuesday 30th July 2024, at the The Heights Hotel, Portland, Dorset, UK. 

This is a great opportunity to work on some up and coming open-source projects and to meet up with other open-source developers here in the UK. Whether you are new to open-source geospatial development or have been working in the industry for years we hope this event will be the summer work-cation you need!

Check out the [page](code-sprint-2024.html) for more details, and if you have any questions, please email us <span class="osgeoemail"></span>.

### OSGeo:UK Newsletter

In 2024 we plan to start sending a newsletter to the open source geo community in the UK and Ireland on a 2-3 monthly cycle. There will be general news from OSGeo and information about events including the next FOSS4GUK which we hope will be an "in person" event (see [this link](foss4guk2024/index.html) or above for details). The newsletter will not replace the UK mailing list which will continue to be the place for discussions.
You can sign up to the newsletter using the dedicated [Sign Up Link](https://stats.sender.net/forms/b4160d/view)

### FOSS4G:UK Local 2023

[FOSS4G:UK Local 2023](foss4guklocal2023/index.html) went really well. It was held on Thurs 7th Sept, and we reached about 250 people across eight venues in two countries. We raised about £5000 for OSGeo:UK which will go towards our funding of Open Source Geospatial software over the coming year. The full programme is available in [PDF](foss4guklocal2023/2023_MAIN_Agenda - Google Sheets.pdf){:target="_newpage"} or [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ewkqvMZqXIwDtyEtCxdKte7czpZxUjqqlCZkY1REmzc/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_newpage"}. See individual [venue pages](foss4guklocal2023/index.html#venues) pages for more details. 

We have done a short [write up](foss4guklocal2023/lessons-learned.html), summarising some of the feedback and highlighting a few of the lessons learned for next time. We’re planning to run a conference in 2024, and will be asking for volunteers early next year - so please sign up to the [mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk) or email <span class="osgeoemail"></span> to find out when we’ll be meeting to discuss this.
